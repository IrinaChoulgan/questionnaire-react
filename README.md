I created this small application to test the theoretical knowledge of HTML/CSS, JS, React.

The application was written using React, using SASS, the i18next library for multilingualism (Ukrainian, French). The user's choice of language is stored in localStorage for convenience.
There is also an adaptive layout for 3 breakpoints (mobile version (320 px), tablet version (768 px) and desktop version (1280 px).

It is also possible to change the theme on the site (light-dark), implemented with saving to localStorage for convenience.

Application deployed on Notlify.
